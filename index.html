				<h3><b>A bit about the builder </b></h3>
Sha is, and aspires to be, a lifelong explorer, learner, problem solver and storyteller. Propelled by her curiosity about the world and the stories it holds, she most recently traveled to Asia to work in the television industry. A serendipitous start with the first season of The Amazing Race: China Rush was followed by a two year stint in Singapore working as a TV producer. During this time Sha worked on multiple television shows that took her across Asia and into the underbelly of Singapore (if there ever was one) and picked up just enough Singlish to amuse her friends.
 
Through her work Sha was challenged to find and deliver stories meant to educate and entertain while creatively maneuvering production processes against time and financial constraints. After filming in seven countries Sha has come to learn that while careful planning and preparation will do wonders in ensuring a smooth production, they are still no match for Murphy&#39;s Law.

			<h3>Because life's an adventure...</h3>
Sha finds herself at the beginning of her next adventure, in Chicago, learning about UX/UI.
